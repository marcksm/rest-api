# REST API in Node
This is an API REST in NodeJS for my application in theVelops following their criteria.

This API uses Node, NPM, MongoDB and mLab for a online database.

For mLab mongo database, I set up a dummy user for tests, you can access by:

```
Using their standard MongoDB URI:
mongodb://marcos:marcos123@ds133162.mlab.com:33162/db_marcos_thevelops
```
or
```
Using mongo shell (I prefer):
mongo ds133162.mlab.com:33162/db_marcos_thevelops -u marcos -p marcos123
```
